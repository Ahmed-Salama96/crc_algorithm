# CRC-Alg.
Class project in Network programming subject at faculty of science. These are two Python codes that perform the CRC functions to send the message to another user and the second code check the incoming messages and verify it but it has no descriptions because it was a challenge in HackerRank website so i hope to understand. Finally I assume that you know what is the CRC algorithm.
